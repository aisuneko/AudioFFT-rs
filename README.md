# AudioFFT-rs
Simple yet extremely stupid audio visualizer demo with Rust / OpenGL + PulseAudio.
Inspired by (actually a RIIR attempt of) [https://github.com/Timicasto/AudioFFT](https://github.com/Timicasto/AudioFFT). 
It's a barely working version which also supports logarithm coordinates, just like the original project.
